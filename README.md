# Applied Predictive Modeling: Heart Attack Prediction
USD Data Science group project for modeling the incidence of heart attack using medical data.

Heart attacks occupy a central role in the social consciousness as a commonly known
medical condition with incredibly costly medical consequences as well as considerable financial
implications for both the victims and their families. Therefore, our team has a powerful social
motivation in exploring a data-driven approach to identifying a heart attack in cases of medical
ambiguity, as well as predicting the incidence of a heart attack based on known symptoms and
medical information about a given patient. We hope that our findings are applied, and improved
upon, in medical applications to increase the quality of life.

Our study utilized a sample space of n=303 participants, and is not comprehensive enough to warrant widespread use,
but served as a meaningful exercise in predictive modeling for future medical projects.
